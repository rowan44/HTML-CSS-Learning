    It's been a long day
    Without you, my friend
    And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
    We've come a long way
    From where we began
    Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
    When I see you again

    Damn, who knew?
    All the planes we flew, good things we been through
    That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
    'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
    But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
    Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
    Those were the days, hard work forever pays
    Now I see you in a better place
    Uh

    How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
    Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
    And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

    It's been a long day
    Without you, my friend
    And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
    We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way)
    From where we began (You know where we started)
    Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (Let me tell you)
    When I see you again

    Oh, oh
    Ooh (Yeah)


    First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feelin' strong
    And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
    And that bond'll never be broken, the love will never get lost
    And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed
    Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
    And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

    How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
    Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
    And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

    So let the light guide your way, yeah
    Hold every memory as you go
    And every road you take
    Will always lead you home, home

    It's been a long day
    Without you, my friend
    And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
    We've come a long way
    From where we began
    Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
    When I see you again
    
    Oh (Uh), oh (Yeah-yeah; yeah)
    Ooh (Yo, yo, uh)
    When I see you again (See you again, yeah, yeah)
    Oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah, yeah; oh-oh)
    Ooh (Uh-huh, yup)
    When I see you again
